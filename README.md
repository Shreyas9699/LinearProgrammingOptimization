# LinearProgrammingOptimization

 An Introduction to Linear Programming Optimization (LPOpt), this code explains LP and LPOpt tools with the help of SciPy (Python) and matplotlib for visualization. We use a simple real-life situation, then convert the business need into a Mathematical Linear Problem. Solver the Linear Problem using LPOpt tool.
